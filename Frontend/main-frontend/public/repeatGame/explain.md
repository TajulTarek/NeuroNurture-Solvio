### 1. “আমাদের একটি গাড়ি আছে।” (Amader ekti gari achhe. / We have a car.)
* **`Amader` (আমাদের):** Contains a **retroflex flap /ɽ/**. This sound is produced by the tongue quickly tapping the area behind the alveolar ridge. It's a key rhotic sound in Bangla and can be challenging for some children to articulate.
* **`gari` (গাড়ি):** Features a **voiced velar stop /g/**. This sound is made by blocking airflow with the back of the tongue against the soft palate and then releasing it with vocal cord vibration.

***

### 2. “মৌমাছি ফুল খোঁজে।” (Moumachi phul khoje. / The bee looks for a flower.)
* **`Moumachi` (মৌমাছি):** This is a **multisyllabic word**. Its length and complexity test a child’s **auditory memory** and the motor planning needed to produce a sequence of sounds accurately.
* **`phul` (ফুল)::** Includes an **aspirated bilabial stop /pʰ/**. This is a "p" sound with a strong puff of air. The aspiration can be difficult for children to control.

***

### 3. “দাদু এখন ঘুমায়।” (Dadu ekhon ghumay. / Grandpa is sleeping now.)
* **`Dadu` (দাদু):** Contains a **voiced dental stop /d/**. This sound is made with the tongue against the back of the front teeth.
* **`ghumay` (ঘুমায়):** Features a **voiced aspirated velar stop /ɡʱ/**. This sound is a complex "g" sound with both vocal cord vibration and a strong puff of air, which can be a key point of difficulty in articulation.

### 4. “কুকুরটি ঘেউ ঘেউ করছে।” (Kukur-ti ghe'u ghe'u korchhe. / The dog is barking.)
* **`This sentence is an excellent choice for a repetition test because it targets several key aspects of speech and language development.

1. Onomatopoeia: The phrase "ঘেউ ঘেউ" (ghe'u ghe'u) is an onomatopoeia, a word that phonetically imitates the sound it describes. This tests a child's ability to produce a non-standard, repetitive sound pattern. It is less about a specific phoneme and more about the motor-speech planning and acoustic memory required to mimic the sound.

2. Reduplication: The repetition of "ঘেউ ঘেউ" (ghe'u ghe'u) is a form of reduplication, a common linguistic feature in many languages, including Bangla. This checks if the child can accurately reproduce the repeated syllables. Children with ASD may struggle with this type of repetitive motor planning, or their repetition may be flat and robotic, lacking the natural rhythm.

3. Present Progressive Tense: The verb "করছে" (korchhe) is in the present progressive tense. This tests the child's ability to process and repeat a more complex verb form, which indicates an action happening right now, as opposed to a simple past or future tense.

4. Phonology: The sentence contains the velar stop /k/ in "কুকুরটি" (kukur-ti) and the voiced aspirate /ɡʱ/ in "ঘেউ ঘেউ" (ghe'u ghe'u), which are two distinct and important sounds to assess for clear articulation.

### 5. “পাখি উড়ে আকাশে।” (Pakhi-ti ure akashe. / The bird flew in the sky.)
* **`Pakhi` (পাখি):** Contains a **bilabial stop /p/** and a **velar stop /k/**, with the latter being aspirated.
* **`ure` (উড়ে):** Features a **retroflex flap /ɽ/**.
* **`akashe` (আকাশে):** Includes a **palatal fricative /ʃ/** (like the "sh" in "shoe"). This sentence is a good example of how different consonant types can be combined.

***

### 6. “সে ভাত খায় না।” (She bhat khay na. / He does not eat rice.)
* **`na` (না):** The word "na" (not) is the key feature here, as it tests the child's ability to process and repeat a **negative statement**.
* **`bhat` (ভাত):** Contains a **voiced aspirated bilabial stop /bʱ/**, a "bh" sound with a puff of air.
* **`khay` (খায়):** Includes an **aspirated velar stop /kʰ/**.

***

### 7. “নদীতে নৌকা চলে।” (Nodite nouka chole. / A boat is running in the river.)
* **`Nodite` (নদীতে):** Features a **voiced dental stop /d/**.
* **`chole` (চলে):** Contains a **palatal affricate /cʰ/**, a sound that starts like a "t" and ends like a "sh," with a puff of air.

***

### 8. “বাবা আমাকে খেলনা দেয়।” (Baba amake khelna dey. / Father gives me a toy.)
* **`Baba` (বাবা):** Repetition of the **bilabial stop /b/**, an early-developing sound. Its correct production confirms mastery of basic articulation.
* **`khelna` (খেলনা):** The **aspirated velar stop /kʰ/** tests a child's ability to produce sounds with aspiration. The two syllables also test **auditory memory** and motor planning.

***

### 9. “আমি দুটি কুকুর দেখেছি।” (Ami du-ti kukur dekhechi. / I saw two dogs.)
* **`kukur` (কুকুর):** The repetition of the **velar stop /k/** checks for consistency in articulation. If a child can say one /k/ but not the other, it may indicate a motor planning issue.
* **`dekhechi` (দেখেছি):** This word is a **past tense verb**, which adds a new grammatical structure to the test, moving beyond simple present tense.

***

### 10. “হাঁস পানিতে সাঁতার কাটে।” (Hash panite satar kate. / The duck swims in the water.)
* **`Hash` (হাঁস):** Tests the **glottal fricative /h/**.
* **`panite` (পানিতে):** Contains a **bilabial stop /p/**.
* **`satar` (সাঁতার):** Includes an **alveolar fricative /s/**. The presence of multiple sound types in a single sentence allows for a quick and broad articulation check.
