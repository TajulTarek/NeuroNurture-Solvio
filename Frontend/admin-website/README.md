## Configuration

The admin website runs on port 3001 by default to avoid conflicts with the main application. You can modify this in `vite.config.ts`.

## Development

### Adding New Features

1. Create new components in the `components/` directory
2. Add new routes in `Dashboard.tsx`
3. Update navigation in the sidebar
4. Add any new UI components to `components/ui/`

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling
- Follow the existing design system
- Use shadcn/ui components for consistency

### State Management

- Use React Context for global state (auth, user preferences)
- Use local state for component-specific data
- Use React Query for server state management (when API is integrated)

## API Integration

### Authentication ✅

- **Completed**: Integrated with JWT authentication service
- **Endpoints**: Uses `/auth/login`, `/auth/session`, `/auth/me`, `/auth/logout`
- **Security**: JWT tokens in httpOnly cookies, role-based access

### Data Integration (Pending)

The current version uses mock data for:

- User management data
- Pending requests
- Subscription information
- Support tickets

To complete the integration:

1. Replace mock data with real API calls
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Add loading states and error boundaries
4. Connect to respective backend services

## Security Considerations

- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use HTTPS in production
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement rate limiting
- Regular security audits

## Contributing

1. Follow the existing code style
2. Add proper TypeScript types
3. Include error handling
4. Test thoroughly before submitting
